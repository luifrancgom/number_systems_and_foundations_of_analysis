# Finite, Infinite and Denumerable Sets and Cardinal Numbers

We say that sets $A$ and $B$ are equinumerous if and only if there is a one-one correspondence between $A$ and $B$, $F: A \xrightarrow[onto]{1-1} B$. We shall write $A \approx B$ to mean that $A$ and $B$ are equinumerous.

::: {#thm-equinumerous-equivalence-relation}

If $\mathscr{F}$ is an arbitrary collection of sets where $A \in \mathscr{F}$, $B \in \mathscr{F}$ and $C \in \mathscr{F}$ then $\approx$ is an equivalence relation on $\mathscr{F}$:

a. $A \approx A$
b. $A \approx B \Longrightarrow B \approx A$
c. $(A \approx B \land B \approx C) \Longrightarrow A \approx C$

Two sets which are equinumerous are said to have the same cardinal number. We assume that each set $A$ has an associate cardinal number $\mathscr{K}(A)$. Hence, $\mathscr{K}(A) = \mathscr{K}(B) \iff A \approx B$.

::: {#def-less-equal-than-and-less-than-relation-sets}

If $\mathscr{F}$ is an arbitrary collection of sets where $A \in \mathscr{F}$ and $B \in \mathscr{F}$ the relations $\leq$ and $<$ on $\mathscr{F}$ are defined as:  

a. $A \leq B \iff \exists F (F: A \xrightarrow[]{1-1} B)$

b. $A < B \iff A \leq B \land A \not \approx B$

**Note**: $A \not \approx B$ means $\neg(A \approx B)$. Therefore $A \leq B \land A \not \approx B$ means that it $\exists F (F: A \xrightarrow[]{1-1} B \land \neg(F: A \xrightarrow[onto]{} B))$

We can define an other relation $<_K$ on cardinal numbers. Let $\mathfrak{m}$ and $\mathfrak{n}$ be cardinal numbers. Take any sets $A$ and $B$ having cardinal numbers $\mathfrak{m}$ and $\mathfrak{n}$ respectively. By @thm-less-equal-than-and-less-than-relation-sets g and h it does not make any difference in these definitions which sets $A$ and $B$ we choose having cardinal numbers $\mathfrak{m}$ and $\mathfrak{n}$, respectively.  

One can obtain theorems about cardinal numbers analogous to those proved above. For example, the analogue of @thm-less-equal-than-and-less-than-relation-sets b is $(\mathfrak{m} <_K \mathfrak{n} \land \mathfrak{n} <_K \mathfrak{p}) \Longrightarrow \mathfrak{m} <_K \mathfrak{p}$, for any cardinal numbers $\mathfrak{m}$, $\mathfrak{n}$ and $\mathfrak{p}$.

All the results in @cor-schroder-bernstein-theorem and others formulated in terms of $\approx$, $\leq$ and $<$ can be reformulated in terms of cardinal numbers. For example @cor-schroder-bernstein-theorem a becomes $\mathfrak{m} \leq_K \mathfrak{n} \Longrightarrow \mathfrak{n} \not <_K \mathfrak{m}$ for any cardinal numbers $\mathfrak{m}$ and $\mathfrak{n}$.

1. Prove that there is no universal set $U$ of all sets. (Hint: $\mathscr{P}(U) \leq U$ since $\mathscr{P}(U) \subseteq U$. Use @cor-schroder-bernstein-theorem a and @thm-cantor-theorem)

Another apparently simple fact about sets is that, for any sets $A$ and $B$ either $A \leq B$ or $B \leq A$. This result is know as the Trichotomy Law and turns out to be equivalent to the Axiom of Choice.

Lets us turn now to the study of finite sets. If $n$ is a positive number let:

$$P_n = \{ k \in \mathbb{P} \mid k \leq n \}$$

For example, $P_1 = \{ 1 \}, P_2 = \{ 1, 2 \}, \ldots P_n = \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$

::: {#def-finite-set}

## Finite set

We say that a set $A$ is finite if and only if:

$$A = \emptyset \lor \exists n (A \approx P_n)$$

:::

The notion in @def-finite-set should be distinguished from the notion of finite sequence. By a finite sequence we mean function $a: P_n \longrightarrow A$ for some positive number $n$. The number $n$ is called the length of the sequence and the values of the function, $a(k)$ where $k \leq n$, are called the terms of the sequence. Also it is traditional to write $a_k$ instead of $a(k)$.

::: {#def-infinite-set}

## Infinite set

We say that a set $A$ is infinite if and only if it is not finite. That is:

$$A \neq \emptyset \land \neg\exists n (A \approx P_n)$$

If $B \approx P_n$ we say that $B$ has $n$ elements or that $n$ is the number of elements in $B$. Also we assign the following cardinal numbers $\mathscr{K}(\emptyset) = 0$ and $\mathscr{K}(P_n) = n$. Thus if $B$ has $n$ elements $\mathscr{K}(B)=n$.
