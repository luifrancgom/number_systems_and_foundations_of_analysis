Pure set theory deals exclusively withsets, so the only sets under consideration are those whose members arealso sets. The theory of the hereditarily-finite sets, namelythose finite sets whose elements are also finite sets, the elements ofwhich are also finite, and so on, is formally equivalent toarithmetic. So, the essence of set theory is the study of infinitesets, and therefore it can be defined as the mathematical theory ofthe actual—as opposed to potential—infinite.},
