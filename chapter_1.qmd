# Basic Facts and Notions of Logic and Set Theory

This chapter introduces the concepts and terminology of logic and set theory.

What sets aside mathematics from other disciplines is its reliance on proof [@bilaniuk_problem_2009, p. ix]. But what is a proof? In an informal way a proof is any reasoned argument accepted as such by other mathematicians [@bilaniuk_problem_2009, p. ix].

In that sense mathematical logic is concerned with formalizing and analyzing the kinds of reasoning used in the rest of mathematics [@bilaniuk_problem_2009, p. ix].

## Propositional logic

Propositional logic attempts to make precise the relationships that certain connectives like *not*, *and*, *or*, and *if ... then* [@bilaniuk_problem_2009, p. x].

### Language

First we will define the formal language of propositional logic, $\mathcal{L}_P$, by specifying the symbols and formulas

::: {#def-symbols-lp}
## Symbols of $\mathcal{L}_P$

The symbols of $\mathcal{L}_P$ are:

-   Parentheses: $($ and $)$
-   Connectives: $\neg$ and $\Longrightarrow$
-   Atomic formulas: $A_0, A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n, \ldots$
:::

Then we specify the ways in which the symbols of $\mathcal{L}_P$ can be put together.

::: {#def-formulas-lp}
## Formulas of $\mathcal{L}_P$

The formulas of $\mathcal{L}_P$ are those finite sequences or strings of the symbols given in @def-symbols-lp which satisfy the following rules:

-   Every atomic formula is a formula
-   If $\alpha$ is a formula, then $(\neg \alpha)$ is a formula
-   If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are formulas, then $(\alpha \Longrightarrow \beta)$ is a formula
-   No other sequence of symbols is a formula
:::

In @def-symbols-lp and @def-formulas-lp parentheses are just punctuation where their purpose is to group other symbols together, $\neg$ and $\Longrightarrow$ represent the connectives *not* and *if ... then* and the atomic formulas represent statements that cannot be broken down any further using our connectives. Finally we specify that a well formed formula can only be obtained by the first 3 rules pointed out in @def-formulas-lp[^chapter_1-1].

[^chapter_1-1]: See [@church_introduction_1996, p. 70] for more details.

::: {#exr-parentheses}
Show that every formula of $\mathcal{L}_P$ has the same number of left parentheses as it has of right parentheses.
:::

::: {#sol-parentheses}
By strong induction on $n$, the number of connectives (occurrences of $\neg$ or $\Longrightarrow$) in a formula $\varphi$ of $\mathcal{L}_P$

*Base step* $(n = 0)$: If $\varphi$ is a formula of $\mathcal{L}_P$ with no connectives by @def-formulas-lp is an atomic formula. Since an atomic formula has no parentheses is has the same left as right parentheses.

*Induction hypothesis* $(n \leq k)$: Assume a formula with $n \leq k$ connectives has the same left as right parentheses.

*Induction step* $(n = k + 1)$: Suppose $\varphi$ is a formula with $n = k + 1$ connectives. From @def-formulas-lp $\varphi$ must be either:

-   $(\neg \alpha)$ for some formula $\alpha$ with $k$ connectives.

    -   By the *induction hypothesis* $\alpha$ has the same left as right parentheses so $(\neg \alpha)$ also have the same left as right parentheses.

-   $(\beta \Longrightarrow \gamma)$ for some formulas $\beta$ and $\gamma$ with $\leq k$ connectives each.

    -   By the *induction hypothesis* $\beta$ and $\gamma$ have the same left as right parentheses so $(\beta \Longrightarrow \gamma)$ also has the same left as right parentheses.

::: {#exr-length-parentheses}
Suppose $\alpha$ is any formula of $\mathcal{L}_P$. Let $l(\alpha)$ be the length of $\alpha$ as a sequence of symbols and let $p(\alpha)$ be the number of parentheses (counting both left and right parentheses) in $\alpha$. What are the minimum and maximum values of $\frac{p(\alpha)}{l(\alpha)}$?
:::

::: {#sol-length-parentheses}
The minimum value of $p(\alpha)$ is $0$ when $\alpha$ is an atomic formula. Therefore the minimum value of $\frac{p(\alpha)}{l(\alpha)}$ is $0$ because $p(\alpha) \geq 0$ and $l(\alpha) \geq 1$.

In the case of other values lets inspect the possible values of $p(\alpha)$ and $l(\alpha)$:

-   For $p(\alpha)$ the possible values are $0, 2, 4, \ldots, 2m, \ldots$.

-   For $l(\alpha)$ we can begin with an atomic formula, $A_0$, and then add $3$ or $4$ symbols to create a well formed formula:

    -   $(\neg A_0)$
    -   $(A_0 \Longrightarrow A_1)$

```{r}

```

Where the possible values of $l(\alpha)$ are $1, 4, 5, 7, 8, \ldots, s - 1, s, s + 1, \ldots$ as it is shown in @fig-length-formula-lp where the majority of duplicate branches with the same lengths are omitted but can be different in relation to $p(\alpha)$.

        child {node {10 (6)}
          child {node {13 (8)}}
          child {node {14 (8)}} 
        } 
        child {node {11 (6)}
          child {node {15 (8)}}
        } 
      } 
      child {node {8 (4)}
        child {node {12 (6)}
          child {node {16 (8)}}        
        } 
      }
    }
    child {node {5 (2)}
      child {node {9 (4)}
        child {node {13 (6)}
          child {node {17 (8)}}        
        }
      }
    };
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Therefore we can examine the leftmost branch.

-   For the lefmost branch we have for $\frac{p(\alpha)}{l(\alpha)} = \frac{0}{1}, \frac{2}{4}, \frac{4}{7}, \frac{6}{10}, \frac{8}{13}, \ldots, \frac{2n}{3n + 1}, \ldots$. Therefore $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2n}{3n + 1} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3}$.

Therefore $0 \leq \frac{p(\alpha)}{l(\alpha)}$ and $\frac{p(\alpha)}{l(\alpha)} < \frac{2}{3}$ for the lefmost branch

::: {#exr-atomic-implies}
Suppose $\alpha$ is any formula of $\mathcal{L}_P$. Let $s(\alpha)$ be the number of atomic formulas in $\alpha$ (counting repetitions) and let $c(\alpha)$ be the number of occurrences of $\Longrightarrow$ in $\alpha$. Show that $s(\alpha) = c(\alpha) + 1$.
:::

::: {#sol-atomic-implies}
By strong induction on $n$, the number of connectives (occurrences of $\neg$ or $\Longrightarrow$) in a formula $\varphi$ of $\mathcal{L}_P$

*Base step* $(n = 0)$: If $\varphi$ is a formula of $\mathcal{L}_P$ with no connectives by @def-formulas-lp is an atomic formula. Since an atomic formula has no $\Longrightarrow$ then $c(\varphi) = 0$ and $s(\varphi) = 1$ and so $s(\varphi) = c(\varphi) + 1$.

*Induction hypothesis* $(n \leq k)$: Assume that for a formula with $n \leq k$ connectives $s(\varphi) = c(\varphi) + 1$.

*Induction step* $(n = k + 1)$: Suppose $\varphi$ is a formula with $n = k + 1$ connectives. From @def-formulas-lp $\varphi$ must be either:

-   $(\neg \alpha)$ for some formula $\alpha$ with $k$ connectives.

    -   By the *induction hypothesis* for $\alpha$ we have that $s(\alpha) = c(\alpha) + 1$. Therefore for $(\neg \alpha)$ we have also that $s((\neg \alpha)) = c((\neg \alpha)) + 1$.

-   $(\beta \Longrightarrow \gamma)$ for some formulas $\beta$ and $\gamma$ with $\leq k$ connectives each.

    -   By the *induction hypothesis* for $\beta$ and $\gamma$ we have that $s(\beta) = c(\beta) + 1$ and $s(\gamma) = c(\gamma) + 1$. Therefore $s((\beta \Longrightarrow \gamma)) = c(\beta) + c(\gamma) + 1 + 1$. But $c(\beta) + c(\gamma) + 1 = c((\beta \Longrightarrow \gamma))$ so $s((\beta \Longrightarrow \gamma)) = c((\beta \Longrightarrow \gamma)) + 1$

::: {#exr-length-formulas-lp}
What are the possible lengths of formulas of $\mathcal{L}_P$? Prove it.
:::

::: {#sol-length-formulas-lp}
Using @sol-length-parentheses and @fig-length-formula-lp the possible possible lengths of formulas of $\mathcal{L}_P$ are $1, 4, 5, 7, 8, \ldots, s - 1, s, s + 1, \ldots$.  
:::

::: {#exr-without-punctuation-lp}
Find a way for doing without parentheses or other
punctuation symbols in defining a formal language for $\mathcal{L}_P$.
:::

::: {#sol-without-punctuation-lp}
See [@lukasiewicz_selected_1970, p. 180] which is called Lukasiewicz or Polish notation

In Polish notation, logical operators are placed before their operands. This prefix positioning eliminates the need for parentheses, as the order of operations is strictly determined by the operator sequence.

So using @def-formulas-lp we have that:

-   Every atomic formula is a formula
-   If $\alpha$ is a formula, then $\neg \alpha$ is a formula
-   If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are formulas, then $\Longrightarrow \alpha \beta$ is a formula
-   No other sequence of symbols is a formula

For example $(((\neg \alpha) \Longrightarrow \beta) \Longrightarrow (\neg \gamma))$ can be written using Polish and modern notation as $\Longrightarrow \Longrightarrow \neg \alpha \beta \neg \gamma$

Also Polish notation is not ambiguous. For example:

-  $((\alpha \Longrightarrow \beta) \Longrightarrow \gamma)$ is written as $\Longrightarrow \Longrightarrow \alpha \beta \gamma$  

-  $(\alpha \Longrightarrow (\beta \Longrightarrow \gamma))$ is written as $\Longrightarrow \alpha \Longrightarrow \beta \gamma$
