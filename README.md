The aim of this book is to study the basic number system of mathematics using as a principal guide **Number Systems and the Foundations of Analysis** by Elliton Mendelson and other supplementary materials.

The idea is to develop all the topics and solve the exercises proposed in this book as it has done in [Mathematical Adventures](https://www.youtube.com/@mathematicaladventures)
