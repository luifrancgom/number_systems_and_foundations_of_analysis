    "text": "1.1.1 Language\nFirst we will define the formal language of propositional logic, \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\), by specifying the symbols and formulas\n\nDefinition 1.1 (Symbols of \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\)) The symbols of \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\) are:\n\nParentheses: \\((\\) and \\()\\)\nConnectives: \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\Longrightarrow\\)\nAtomic formulas: \\(A_0, A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n, \\ldots\\)\n\n\nThen we specify the ways in which the symbols of \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\) can be put together.\n\nDefinition 1.2 (Formulas of \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\)) The formulas of \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\) are those finite sequences or strings of the symbols given in Definition 1.1 which satisfy the following rules:\n\nEvery atomic formula is a formula\nIf \\(\\alpha\\) is a formula, then \\((\\neg \\alpha)\\) is a formula\nIf \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are formulas, then \\((\\alpha \\Longrightarrow \\beta)\\) is a formula\nNo other sequence of symbols is a formula\n\n\nIn Definition 1.1 and Definition 1.2 parentheses are just punctuation where their purpose is to group other symbols together, \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\Longrightarrow\\) represent the connectives not and if … then and the atomic formulas represent statements that cannot be broken down any further using our connectives. Finally we specify that a well formed formula can only be obtained by the first 3 rules pointed out in Definition 1.21.\n\nExercise 1.1 Show that every formula of \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\) has the same number of left parentheses as it has of right parentheses.\n\n\nSolution 1.1. By strong induction on \\(n\\), the number of connectives (occurrences of \\(\\neg\\) or \\(\\Longrightarrow\\)) in a formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\)\nBase step \\((n = 0)\\): If \\(\\varphi\\) is a formula of \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\) with no connectives by Definition 1.2 is an atomic formula. Since an atomic formula has no parentheses is has the same left as right parentheses.\nInduction hypothesis \\((n \\leq k)\\): Assume a formula with \\(n \\leq k\\) connectives has the same left as right parentheses.\nInduction step \\((n = k + 1)\\): Suppose \\(\\varphi\\) is a formula with \\(n = k + 1\\) connectives. From Definition 1.2 \\(\\varphi\\) must be either:\n\n\\((\\neg \\alpha)\\) for some formula \\(\\alpha\\) with \\(k\\) connectives.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis \\(\\alpha\\) has the same left as right parentheses so \\((\\neg \\alpha)\\) also have the same left as right parentheses.\n\n\\((\\beta \\Longrightarrow \\gamma)\\) for some formulas \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) with \\(\\leq k\\) connectives each.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) have the same left as right parentheses so \\((\\beta \\Longrightarrow \\gamma)\\) also has the same left as right parentheses.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.2 Suppose \\(\\alpha\\) is any formula of \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\). Let \\(l(\\alpha)\\) be the length of \\(\\alpha\\) as a sequence of symbols and let \\(p(\\alpha)\\) be the number of parentheses (counting both left and right parentheses) in \\(\\alpha\\). What are the minimum and maximum values of \\(\\frac{p(\\alpha)}{l(\\alpha)}\\)?\n\n\nSolution 1.2. The minimum value of \\(p(\\alpha)\\) is \\(0\\) when \\(\\alpha\\) is an atomic formula. Therefore the minimum value of \\(\\frac{p(\\alpha)}{l(\\alpha)}\\) is \\(0\\) because \\(p(\\alpha) \\geq 0\\) and \\(l(\\alpha) \\geq 1\\).\nIn the case of other values lets inspect the possible values of \\(p(\\alpha)\\) and \\(l(\\alpha)\\):\n\nFor \\(p(\\alpha)\\) the possible values are \\(0, 2, 4, \\ldots, 2m, \\ldots\\).\nFor \\(l(\\alpha)\\) we can begin with an atomic formula, \\(A_0\\), and then add \\(3\\) or \\(4\\) symbols to create a well formed formula:\n\n\\((\\neg A_0)\\)\n\\((A_0 \\Longrightarrow A_1)\\)\n\n\nWhere the possible values of \\(l(\\alpha)\\) are \\(1, 4, 5, 7, 8, \\ldots, s - 1, s, s + 1, \\ldots\\) as it is shown in Figure 1.1 where the majority of duplicate branches with the same lengths are omitted but can be different in relation to \\(p(\\alpha)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Possible values of \\(l(\\alpha)\\) and associated \\(p(\\alpha)\\) values in parentheses\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore we can examine the leftmost branch.\n\nFor the lefmost branch we have for \\(\\frac{p(\\alpha)}{l(\\alpha)} = \\frac{0}{1}, \\frac{2}{4}, \\frac{4}{7}, \\frac{6}{10}, \\frac{8}{13}, \\ldots, \\frac{2n}{3n + 1}, \\ldots\\). Therefore \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2n}{3n + 1} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nTherefore \\(0 \\leq \\frac{p(\\alpha)}{l(\\alpha)}\\) and \\(\\frac{p(\\alpha)}{l(\\alpha)} &lt; \\frac{2}{3}\\) for the lefmost branch\n\n\nExercise 1.3 Suppose \\(\\alpha\\) is any formula of \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\). Let \\(s(\\alpha)\\) be the number of atomic formulas in \\(\\alpha\\) (counting repetitions) and let \\(c(\\alpha)\\) be the number of occurrences of \\(\\Longrightarrow\\) in \\(\\alpha\\). Show that \\(s(\\alpha) = c(\\alpha) + 1\\).\n\n\nSolution 1.3. By strong induction on \\(n\\), the number of connectives (occurrences of \\(\\neg\\) or \\(\\Longrightarrow\\)) in a formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\)\nBase step \\((n = 0)\\): If \\(\\varphi\\) is a formula of \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\) with no connectives by Definition 1.2 is an atomic formula. Since an atomic formula has no \\(\\Longrightarrow\\) then \\(c(\\varphi) = 0\\) and \\(s(\\varphi) = 1\\) and so \\(s(\\varphi) = c(\\varphi) + 1\\).\nInduction hypothesis \\((n \\leq k)\\): Assume that for a formula with \\(n \\leq k\\) connectives \\(s(\\varphi) = c(\\varphi) + 1\\).\nInduction step \\((n = k + 1)\\): Suppose \\(\\varphi\\) is a formula with \\(n = k + 1\\) connectives. From Definition 1.2 \\(\\varphi\\) must be either:\n\n\\((\\neg \\alpha)\\) for some formula \\(\\alpha\\) with \\(k\\) connectives.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis for \\(\\alpha\\) we have that \\(s(\\alpha) = c(\\alpha) + 1\\). Therefore for \\((\\neg \\alpha)\\) we have also that \\(s((\\neg \\alpha)) = c((\\neg \\alpha)) + 1\\).\n\n\\((\\beta \\Longrightarrow \\gamma)\\) for some formulas \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) with \\(\\leq k\\) connectives each.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis for \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) we have that \\(s(\\beta) = c(\\beta) + 1\\) and \\(s(\\gamma) = c(\\gamma) + 1\\). Therefore \\(s((\\beta \\Longrightarrow \\gamma)) = c(\\beta) + c(\\gamma) + 1 + 1\\). But \\(c(\\beta) + c(\\gamma) + 1 = c((\\beta \\Longrightarrow \\gamma))\\) so \\(s((\\beta \\Longrightarrow \\gamma)) = c((\\beta \\Longrightarrow \\gamma)) + 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.4 What are the possible lengths of formulas of \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\)? Prove it.\n\n\nSolution 1.4. Using Solution 1.2 and Figure 1.1 the possible possible lengths of formulas of \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\) are \\(1, 4, 5, 7, 8, \\ldots, s - 1, s, s + 1, \\ldots\\).\n\n\nExercise 1.5 Find a way for doing without parentheses or other punctuation symbols in defining a formal language for \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\).\n\n\nSolution 1.5. See (Łukasiewicz and Borkowski 1970, 180) which is called Lukasiewicz or Polish notation\nIn Polish notation, logical operators are placed before their operands. This prefix positioning eliminates the need for parentheses, as the order of operations is strictly determined by the operator sequence.\nSo using Definition 1.2 we have that:\n\nEvery atomic formula is a formula\nIf \\(\\alpha\\) is a formula, then \\(\\neg \\alpha\\) is a formula\nIf \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are formulas, then \\(\\Longrightarrow \\alpha \\beta\\) is a formula\nNo other sequence of symbols is a formula\n\nFor example \\((((\\neg \\alpha) \\Longrightarrow \\beta) \\Longrightarrow (\\neg \\gamma))\\) can be written using Polish and modern notation as \\(\\Longrightarrow \\Longrightarrow \\neg \\alpha \\beta \\neg \\gamma\\)\nAlso Polish notation is not ambiguous. For example:\n\n\\(((\\alpha \\Longrightarrow \\beta) \\Longrightarrow \\gamma)\\) is written as \\(\\Longrightarrow \\Longrightarrow \\alpha \\beta \\gamma\\)\n\\((\\alpha \\Longrightarrow (\\beta \\Longrightarrow \\gamma))\\) is written as \\(\\Longrightarrow \\alpha \\Longrightarrow \\beta \\gamma\\)\n\n\n\nExercise 1.6 Show that the set of formulas of \\(\\mathcal{L}_P\\) is countable.\n\n\nSolution 1.6.
